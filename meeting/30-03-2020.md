Meeting Notes
* Project:E.coli bateria image segmentation
* Advisor:Prof. Long CHEN
* Member: DB623033 LIN GUANGZE & DB611408 LI QIANYUN

## Finished Items
* Count the number of cells in the image via Hough Transformation. Inspired by the idea of finding circles, we think maybe this method can be used to approximately count the number of cells within the image. Since the 'imfindcircles' function will return the center and radius of the all the found circle specified by the user, we can get the number of cells by getting the length of the array. 
* We also visualize the results(i.e. the circles found) in the image and compare it with the original image to see the performance.

## Discussion Summary & Challenge
* Professor Chen advised that we should compare the results of two different counting methods: Cell Size Approximation and Circle Labeling using Hough Transformation and analyze the differences.
* Professor Chen said that the counting of cells now using Hough Transformation that we developed right now can only give an approximate number of cells, this method should be improved to have better performance.
* Professor Chen also advised that we should try to fusion the result of the image segmentation and the Circle Labeling using Hough Transformation.

## Schedule
* We plan to modify our current counting methods and improve the GUI of our program(probably make it more portable) next month
